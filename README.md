avr-alert
=========

Simple (and naive) burglar alarm for AVR Butterfly written in Ada language.

It works by detecting sudden temperature changes (which will appear when a window is broken) and emitting sound.
Because of such construction it works well mainly in winter ;).

I wrote it as a student project.
